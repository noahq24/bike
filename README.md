# NYC Citi Bike Case Study: Navigating Speedy Success

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Scenario
As a Junior Data Analyst at Citi Bike, NYCâ€™s bike-share service, I am tasked with a new project aimed at maximizing annual memberships. According to the Marketing Director, understanding the usage patterns of **casual riders** (single-ride or full-day pass users) versus **annual members** will be essential to drive data-driven marketing strategies and boost memberships.

This study focuses on analyzing **2023 Citi Bike data** to uncover insights on usage patterns between these groups.
